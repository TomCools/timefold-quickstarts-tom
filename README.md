> They serve as a starting point and/or inspiration when creating your own application.
> Timefold Solver is a library and does not include a UI. To illustrate these use cases a rudimentary UI is included in these quickstarts.

## Use cases

### 🚚 Vehicle Routing

Find the most efficient routes for vehicles to reach visits, considering vehicle capacity and time windows when visits are available. Sometimes also called "CVRPTW".

![Vehicle Routing Screenshot](java/vehicle-routing/vehicle-routing-screenshot.png)

- [Run quarkus-vehicle-routing](java/vehicle-routing/README.MD) (Java, Maven, Quarkus)
- [Run python-vehicle-routing](python/vehicle-routing/README.MD) (Python, FastAPI)

> [!TIP]
>  <img src="https://docs.timefold.ai/_/img/models/field-service-routing.svg" align="right" width="50px" /> [Check out our off-the-shelf model for Field Service Routing](https://app.timefold.ai/models/field-service-routing/v1). This model goes beyond basic Vehicle Routing and supports additional constraints such as priorities, skills, fairness and more.

### 🧑‍💼 Employee Scheduling

Schedule shifts to employees, accounting for employee availability and shift skill requirements.
